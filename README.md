# Swiveling_Shelf

This project simlates a shelf in a cabinet which is able to translate and rotate along an arbitrary path. It uses this simulation to approximate an optimal dimension of shelf by ensuring that the outside edge of the shelf is always touching the cabinet in at least one place at every simulation time-step along its travel.

# Example Demonstration

In this example, the shelf is swiveling around a pivot in the bottom left corner of the cabinet, and simultaneously rotating from 0 degrees through to 70 degrees as it moves through that swivel point (as defined by the bezier curve in orange).
